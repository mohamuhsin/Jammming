# A Spotify like App Called Jammming
The Spotify API was used to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

# The website was built in four parts:

1. Creating Static Components.
2. Passing Information to Components.
3. Setting the State of Jammming Components.
4. Interacting with the Spotify API.
